## Sudoku helper

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

Completed games are always an example of a Latin square, including an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column, or any of the nine 3×3 subregions of the 9×9 playing board.

This tool comes with a set of sodukos. This list is easily extendable in the data.js file. You can just solve the provided sudokus or put in a sudoku
you are struggling with and solve it with one click or just get the next correct number. If you just want a little help you can enable hints to easily find the easiest way to go forward.
